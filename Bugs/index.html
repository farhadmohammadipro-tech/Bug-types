          In casual language, people use <strong>‚Äúbugs‚Äù</strong> to mean all sorts of small
          creepy-crawlies: insects, spiders, etc. However, <strong>‚ÄúBugs‚Äù</strong> (true bugs)
          are actually just one order of insects (Hemiptera). This page
          provides a summary of the main classes or groups of
          creepy-crawlies.

        <p>
          <strong>Beetles</strong> make up the largest order of insects, with more than
          <em>350,000</em> known species. They are recognized by their hardened
          forewings (elytra) that cover and protect the delicate hindwings
          and abdomen. This feature gives them a tough, armored look and
          helps them survive in many environments, from forests to deserts.
          <strong>Beetles</strong> can vary greatly in size, color, and habits, ranging from
          <em>tiny grain beetles</em> to <em>massive stag beetles</em> with impressive jaws.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many <strong>beetles</strong> play important ecological roles. Some, like ladybugs,
          are beneficial predators that feed on crop pests such as aphids.
          Others, such as <strong>dung beetles</strong>, recycle nutrients by breaking down
          animal waste. However, certain species like the Colorado <em>potato
          beetle</em> or <em>Japanese beetle</em> are major agricultural pests. Their
          diversity and adaptability make <strong>beetles</strong> one of the most successful
          groups of insects on Earth.

        <p>
          <strong>True bugs</strong> include a wide range of insects such as stink bugs,
          cicadas, aphids, and water striders. Unlike beetles, their
          forewings are partly hardened and partly membranous, and they
          possess distinctive piercing-sucking mouthparts. These mouthparts
          are adapted for feeding on plant sap, blood, or other insects. Many
          <strong>true bugs</strong> have scent glands that produce strong odors as a defense
          mechanism, which is why some are called <strong>‚Äústink bugs.‚Äù</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>True bugs</strong> are found worldwide and occupy a variety of habitats,
          including plants, soil, and water. While some species are harmless
          or even beneficial predators, others are destructive agricultural
          pests that weaken plants by draining their sap. Certain bugs, like
          <em>bed bugs</em> and <em>kissing bugs</em>, can also affect humans directly by
          biting or transmitting diseases.

        <p>
          <strong>Butterflies</strong> and <strong>moths</strong> are some of the most recognizable insects
          thanks to their large, often colorful wings covered in tiny scales.
          These scales give their wings shimmering, patterned appearances and
          are one of the defining traits of this group. <strong>Butterflies</strong> are
          usually active by day, while moths are mostly nocturnal, though
          there are exceptions. Both undergo complete metamorphosis, with a
          dramatic transformation from caterpillar to winged adult.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>As caterpillars</em>, they primarily feed on leaves, sometimes causing
          damage to crops and plants. As adults, <strong>butterflies</strong> and <strong>many moths</strong>
          are important pollinators, transferring pollen as they sip nectar
          from flowers. They are also ecologically vital as food sources for
          birds, bats, and other animals. Their beauty and ecological
          importance make them a favorite group for nature enthusiasts and
          scientists alike.

        </figure>

        <p>
          <strong>Flies</strong> and <strong>mosquitoes</strong> belong to the order Diptera, meaning <strong>‚Äútwo
          wings.‚Äù</strong> Unlike most other insects, they have only one functional
          pair of wings; the hind pair has evolved into tiny balancing organs
          called halteres. This adaptation gives them incredible agility in
          flight. Their mouthparts vary widely: some species have sponging
          mouthparts <em>(like houseflies)</em>, while others have piercing-sucking
          ones <em>(like mosquitoes)</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          These insects are among the most ecologically and medically
          significant. Many flies are decomposers, helping break down waste
          and recycle nutrients. <strong>Mosquitoes</strong>, however, are infamous as disease
          vectors, spreading malaria, dengue, and other illnesses. Despite
          their negative reputation, <strong>flies</strong> and <strong>mosquitoes</strong> are essential in
          ecosystems, serving as pollinators and as a major food source for
          many animals.

        <p>
          <strong>Bees</strong>, <strong>wasps</strong>, and <strong>ants</strong> are a diverse group known for their complex
          behaviors and social structures. Many species live in colonies with
          distinct roles for <em>workers</em>, <em>queens</em>, and <em>males</em>. <strong>Bees</strong> are especially
          famous for pollination, producing honey, and communicating with
          each other through dances. Wasps are often predators or
          parasitoids, while <strong>ants</strong> are skilled builders and cooperative
          foragers.
        </p>

        <p>
          This group has a huge ecological impact. <strong>Bees</strong> and <strong>wasps</strong> contribute
          to pollination, supporting food crops and wild plants. Some <strong>wasps</strong>
          help control pest populations by preying on or parasitizing other
          insects. Ants are critical soil engineers, aerating the ground and
          recycling nutrients. While stings and aggressive behaviors make
          some species feared, they are vital players in natural and
          agricultural systems.

        <p>
          <strong>Spiders</strong> are <strong>arachnids</strong>, not insects, and are easily distinguished by
          their eight legs and lack of antennae. Almost all spiders are
          predators, using venom and silk to capture prey. Many build
          intricate webs to trap insects, while others are active hunters
          that chase or ambush their food. Their silk is an incredibly strong
          and versatile material, used for webs, egg sacs, or safety lines.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Spiders</strong> are found in nearly every habitat on Earth, from deserts to
          caves to homes. While some people fear them, very few species pose
          a danger to humans. In fact, <strong>spiders</strong> are highly beneficial because
          they help control insect populations, including pests. They play a
          crucial role in balancing ecosystems, making them one of the most
          important non-insect ‚Äúbugs‚Äù people commonly encounter.
